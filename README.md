## Project Overview:
The goal of this project is to obtain insights on reasons why customers exit the company, highlighting trends in retention rates, customer tenure, and the impact of offers and services. These insights are critical to understanding customer behavior and developing strategies to minimize churn while improving overall retention.


## Key Findings
1. Customer Demographics
•	Gender: Male and female customers exhibit similar churn rates, indicating other factors have a stronger influence.
•	Age Groups: Customers aged 30–50 show higher churn rates, with over 1,300 individuals per group. Targeted retention strategies for this demographic could be effective.
•	Marital Status & Dependents: Families with dependents have slightly higher churn rates, potentially influenced by pricing concerns.
2. Churn by Service Type
•	Internet Services:
Fiber Optic customers have the highest churn (3,035 users), followed by DSL (1,652 users).
.	Customers with no internet services churn less frequently (1,526 users), suggesting dissatisfaction with internet quality or pricing is a major factor.
•	Contract Type: Month-to-month contracts exhibit the highest churn, highlighting the need for incentives to encourage long-term commitments.
3. Churn Drivers
•	Primary Reasons:
Competition accounts for 841 churned customers.
Pricing and dissatisfaction collectively contribute to over 500 churn cases.
.	Attitude and other factors are less significant but still noteworthy.
•	Satisfaction Scores: Lower satisfaction scores correlate strongly with higher churn rates, reinforcing the importance of customer support and experience.

4. Revenue Impacts
•	Monthly Revenue: Churned customers represent $8,533.01 in lost revenue, significantly higher than revenue from new customers ($144.22).
•	Lifetime Value (CLTV): Increasing retention by even 5% could boost CLTV by approximately 25%.
5. Tenure and Churn
•	Customers with shorter tenures are more likely to churn, especially within the first 24 months. Churn rates decrease significantly after 36 months, suggesting loyalty incentives for newer customers could reduce churn rates.
6. Retention Offers
•	Offers A and B effectively reduce churn, with churn rates under 7% among recipients. However, offers C and E have minimal impact and could be reconsidered or restructured.

•	Implement proactive outreach to dissatisfied customers to address issues before they churn.
3. Pricing and Value
